# QR CODE TREASURE HUNT
A simple QR Code Based Treasure Hunt Game. Traditional Treasure hunts require pages and manual work. This application aims at going green and paperless. Just Scan the correct QR Code and get the next hint, until you reach the FINAL DESTINATION!

## Getting Started
This app requires nothing more than a Web browser to generate hints. App can be directly installed on the mobile.

### Generating hints
Open Hints-Generator/index.html file. Follow on screen instructions to generate the hints. Hints have to be generated for 10 groups(0 - 9).
After the QR Codes have been generated, they will be saved in the _output_ directory and can be obtained from there.

**The Group Code can be viewed in app at the bottom of the screen or in the log cat**
You can only scan those QR Codes that have been generated for your group code, else it gives an error saying _"Wrong QR Code Scanned"_

## Acknowledgments
The only inspiration was COEP college and the way this geeky college and the students carried out their Treasure Hunt - on paper!!! It felt so heartbreaking to watch such a reputed college where TechnoFreaks reside having their Treasure Hunt on paper.
